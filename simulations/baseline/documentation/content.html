This scenario consists of multiple networks to showcase the different kinds of devices and basic functionality.

The core always consists of the DetCom node and a wirelessly connected part on the left side.
The right side can either have a wired connection or a wireless connection (as in the following two graphics).

Additionally, it includes the PairwiseDelayer and Histogram module to simulate the PDV of a 5G network.

Take a look at the input distributions for uplink and downlink:

And the distribution from the simulation results, as they follow the same distribution:
