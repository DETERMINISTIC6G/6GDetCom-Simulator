This scenario uses our Histogram model to model the PDV of an EdgeCloud.

The network consists of a DetCom node.
It has a wireless talker, a wired backbone network with a connected EdgeCloud using the UdpEdgeCloudApp and a wired listener.
The talker sends periodic messages to the edge cloud, which delays them according to the given distribution and forwards them to the listener.

We provide the simulation with a measured distribution for a given scheduling algorithm (Deadline scheduling in the following example.
The second picture shows the resulting end-to-end delay:

If we additionally add the delay of a measured 5G network, the resulting end-to-end delay is dominated by the 5G PDV:
