This showcase contains the TimeSyncNetwork for simulating time synchronization in a mixed TSN/5G domain.
From the description in D2.2, we can handle the intermediate 5G as one gPTP bridge clock using the TSi and TSe timestamps, with the following differences:

- In contrast to the INET gPTP implementation the TSi and TSe timestamps don't originate from the same clock.
  This needs discussion on how to simulate this behavior, as these timestamps are relevant for the correctionField
- Currently, there seems to be a problem with the correctionField implementation of INET: <a href="https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/issues/920">See here</a>
